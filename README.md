# Natao

Natao is a Markdown Editor that has been specifically designed to help dyspraxic, dysgraphic and dyslexic students easily produce
their homework and compose school/college essays on computers.

Natao is Operating System (OS) independent, that is, it works equally well on OSX, Linux and Windows machines.

## Getting Started

Find the Natao release that corresponds to your computer's OS here:

[releases](https://github.com/Ajrarn/Natao_legacy/releases).

Unzip the application's folder wherever you want on your computer, and start using Natao right away.

## Why another Markdown Editor ?

Unlike other more conventional Markdown Editors, Natao has been designed, from the ground up, to help students write essays and
calculate mathematical formulas clearly, easily, and elegantly.

Natao has also been designed to help its users organize their Natao-produced documents along standardized folder structures.
