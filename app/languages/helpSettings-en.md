# Preferences

When you start Natao for the first time, only three Preferences sections will need your input.

## Your Database File

This is the file that contains all of the documents that you will create within Natao.

## Your Identity

Your first and last names, as well as the name of your course (History, Calculus, etc.), will appear in your Natao document, but only if the document style-sheet you pick permits it.

Please note that, upon using Natao for the first time, only Natao's default "Test" style-sheet can allow you to display that information.

## Your Theme

This section lets you pick Natao's overall color scheme. It can be changed whenever you want.

# Styles

This section lets you modify or create style-sheets.

Two panels are prominently displayed:

* A CSS editor, for you to modify the style-sheet you've picked.
* A visualization panel, for you to look at your document's raw HTML code directly, or at its rendered version.

In a future version of Natao, a virtual assistant will help you modify the style-sheets provided within Natao, without your having to know any CSS syntax or HTML code.
For now though, the Styles section is the only means by which you may edit your documents' appearance.
Ask for help if you need any.

# Structures

This section lets you modify the way your document folders' are organized/structured. Note that the tools you get to use here are similar to the ones found in Natao's Editor panel. The only difference is that you cannot create documents in this section.

# Others

This section allows you do accomplish two tasks:

- Activate the "Guided Tour" buttons, as you saw them when you first booted up Natao. 
- Import the Help Files found in "Documents", for you to edit or print them.
