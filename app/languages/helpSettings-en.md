# Preferences

## Your database file

This is where the file that contains all your Natao documents is stored.

## Your identity

The course and names you write here will appear in your document, if you choose to use a document-style that lets you display that information.

Please note that the default "Test" style-sheet provided by Natao displays that information.

## Your Theme

This lets you pick the overall color of Natao's interface. It can be changed whenever you want.

# Styles

This section lets you modify or create style-sheets.

Two panels let you access:

* A CSS editor, to modify the style-sheet.
* A visualization window, to see either your document's HTML code or its rendered version.

In a future version, a virtual assistant will help you modify the style-sheets provided by Natao, without having to known CSS syntax or HTML code. For now, the Styles Section remains necessary to edit your documents' appearance. Ask for help if you need it.

# Structures

This section lets you manipulate the folders' structures, before getting back in Natao's main Editor panel to work on your documents. The Structures tools are similar to the ones offered by Natao's Editor panel. The only difference is that you cannot create documents here.
