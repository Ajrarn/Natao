# Hello and welcome to Natao.##

**Before We Start**

You may have noticed in the guided tour the buttons which are designed to help you adjust Natao's appearance, or User Interface, to your liking.

Well, start using them: adjust the magnifying glass and the open-dyslexix until you're comfrotable with Natao's User Interface.

You can choose to change Natao's appearance even more, by going into the **Editor** panel. There you will find buttons which will help you add space and/or grey stripes between your document's lines.

# So what's Natao good for?

Natao has been designed to help you easily create elegant documents, filled with text and/or basic mathematical formulae.
To do so, Natao uses a language called Markdown which converts a simple text containing a few structurally significant characters, like hashtag signs ( # ) or star signs ( * ) or greater-than signs ( > ) into an easily readable and clearly formatted document.

Using the Markdown language lets you concentrate on your text body and not on unwieldy formatting windows, as is the case in regular word processing programs. 

Take a look at Natao's text Editor and text Viewer panels. You'll notice that they are very similar to each other, but for two key differences: in the Editor, single hastag ( # ) signs appear, whereas in the Viewer these have been replaced by roman numerals. Similarly, the double hastag ( ## ) signs seen in the Editor window have been replaced by numbers in the Viewer panel.

You can use Markdown signs to create all sorts of design elements within whichever document you write, such as:

# Titles

Insert a single hash ( # ) sign in front of a word or sentence and transform that word or sentence into a title.

 This word is not a title, but this # word is title.

## Sub-titles

This time we're using two hash ( ## ) signs to create a ## subtitle.

### And we can even go further, with three hash ( ### ) signs.

# Emphasizing words or sentences
Star ( * ) signs can be used to emphasize some text, as the two following examples illustrate:

- A single star ( * ) sign put before and after *a portion of text* italicizes it.
- Two star ( * ) signs put before and after **a portion of text** underline and embolden it.

The Markdown syntax offers a lot more tools for you to format your documents properly. We take a look at them in Natao's other Help sections. 

By the way, the Markdown language can be used outside of Natao, to write wikis for instance. So learning it for Natao will pay off in the real world too.

## What if I want to my words to be red and underlined?

I know the feeling.

Well, it so happens that you can personalize the appearance of Natao's default document style.

Take a look at the top of the Editor window, and noticed the *Style* option. Click on it and a drop-down menu will deploy, listing a series of document style-sheets. By switching to any of them, you'll be able to give your document a new appearance.

For instance, by choosing the *Test* style-sheet, you'll get to write down your first and last names, as well as the day's date at the top of a document formatted with a margin, for your teacher's notes and comments.

Moreover, these style-sheets can be modified by you, Natao's user. Each change you implement will be applied to the entirety of your document.


Yes, that's where you'll be able to underline your text's words and turn them red.

# Next Steps

You should now have a better idea of what Natao is and what it can allow you to accomplish. If you decide to go further, click on the question mark icon located at the top-right corner of Natao's interface. A new window will pop up and let you delve deeper into the program.

If you want to print any of the Help documents:

- Click on the *Settings* button, located at the top-right corner of Natao's interface,
- Click on the *Other* thumbnail,
- Click on the *Import* button.

These Help document files will appear in *Documents* which will let you print them.

In any event, I hope you'll find Natao easy to use and useful to your work.

Thanks and good luck!
