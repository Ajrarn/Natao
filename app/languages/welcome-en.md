# Hello and welcome to Natao.##

**Before We Start**

You may have noticed, in the guided tour, the buttons which are designed to help you adjust Natao's appearance, or User Interface, to your liking. Well, don't hesitate to use them, like the magnifying glass for instance, or the *OpenDyslexic* font option, until you're comfortable with Natao's User Interface.

You can choose to change Natao's appearance even more, by going into the **Editor** panel. There you will find buttons which will help you add space and/or gray stripes between your document's lines.

# So what's Natao good for?

Natao has been designed to help you easily create elegant documents, filled with text and even basic mathematical formulae, if you need them.
To do so, Natao uses a computer syntax called Markdown which converts a simple text containing a few structurally significant characters, like hash-tag signs ( # ), star signs ( * ) or greater-than signs ( > ), into an easily readable and clearly formatted document.

Using the Markdown computer language lets you concentrate on your text body and not on unwieldy formatting windows, as is the case in traditional word processing programs. 

Take a look at Natao's text Editor and text Viewer panels. You'll notice that they are very similar to each other, but for two key differences: in the Editor, single hash-tag signs ( # ) appear, whereas in the Viewer these have been replaced by roman numerals. Similarly, the double hash-tag signs ( ## ) seen in the Editor window have been replaced by numbers in the Viewer panel.

Hash-tag signs are only one of the types of characters recognized by Mardown. There are many others, which we will go over in some of Natao's Help documents. Just know that all these characters have one overall function: to help you, the user, create a variety of design elements within whichever document you write. 

Some of these design elements include:

# Titles

Insert a single hash-tag sign ( # ) in front of a word, or sentence, and transform that word or sentence into a title. For instance:

 This word is not a title, but ...
 # these words are a title.

## Sub-titles

This time we're using two hash signs ( ## ) to create a ## subtitle.

### And we can even go further, with three hash signs ( ### ).

# Emphasizing words or sentences

Star signs ( * ) can be used to emphasize some text, as the two following examples illustrate:

- A single star sign ( * ) put before and after *a portion of text* italicizes it.
- Two star signs ( * * ) put before and after **a portion of text** underline and embolden it.

As mentioned earlier, the Markdown syntax offers a lot more tools for you to format your documents properly. We take a look at them in Natao's other Help sections. 

By the way, the Markdown language can be used outside of Natao, to write online Wikis for instance, like Wikipedia. So learning it for Natao will pay off in the real world too.

## What if I want to my words to be red and underlined?

Well, it so happens that you can personalize the appearance of Natao's default document style.

Take a look at the top of the Editor window, and notice the *Style* option. Click on it and a drop-down menu will deploy, listing a series of document style-sheets. By switching to any of them, you'll be able to give the document on which you're working a complete overall.

For instance, by choosing the *Test* style-sheet, you'll get to write down your first and last names, as well as the day's date at the top of a document formatted with a margin, for your teacher's notes and comments.

Moreover, these style-sheets can be modified by you, the Natao's user. Whatever change you implement will be applied to the entirety of the you're currently working on. And, yes, that's how you'll be able to underline your text's words and make them red.

# Next Steps

You should now have a better idea of what Natao is and what it can allow you to accomplish. If you decide to go further, click on the question mark icon located at the top-right corner of Natao's interface. A new window will pop up and let you delve deeper into the program.

By the way, if you want to print any of the Help documents:

- Click on the *Settings* button, located at the top-right corner of Natao's interface,
- Click on the *Other* thumbnail,
- Click on the *Import* button.

These Help document files will appear in *Documents*, which will let you print them.

In any event, I hope you'll find Natao easy to use and useful to your work.

Thanks and good luck!
