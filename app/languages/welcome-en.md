**Hello and welcome to Natao.**

For your own comfort, you may adjust the size of the interface's characters by clicking on the small looking-glass icons visible within the black bar located at the top left of the screen. 
You may also adjust the look of Natao's user-interface by clicking on the gears icon located right above the central panel.

You are probably wondering what Natao is and what it can help you accomplish. The document you are currently reading should help you answer these questions.

# Natao's Interface

Looking at Natao's user-interface, you can notice three panels:

- The left panel is called the "Explorer". It lets you organize the documents you create within Natao.
- The center panel is called the "Editor". It shows the markdown syntax as you write it.
- The right panel is called the "Viewer". It shows how the text appears in its final, formatted form.

# Natao's Two Core Principles

## To help you organize your documents.

Although the Explorer panel operates the way your computer organizes files and documents, it offers additional functions:

- The Explorer is integrated within Natao's interface. You may therefore navigate through your documents and edit them within the program. Indeed, if you were to click on one of the documents visible within the Explorer panel, the selected document would open in Natao's Editor panel, and let you start working immediately.

- The Explorer contains examples of folder structure to help you organize your work. Each folder you create within the panel automatically appears with its own set of sub-folders. You may modify these sub-folders and create your own structures.

- The Explorer allows you to colorize the folder names to highlight and differentiate them.

## To help you write without worrying about formatting.

Working on the content and the formatting of a document within the confines of a traditional desktop publishing program can be cumbersome and time-consuming. In order to modify a text's appearance in such programs, one has to stop typing, select the text to be formated, and click on a button to change its appearance, after having gone through many options. Natao lets you concentrate on a document's content by doing the formatting for you. 

This is where the Markdown approach of composing documents comes in.

What's Markdown?

The Markdown language was created in 2004 by John Gruber, with significant help from Aaron Swartz. It purports to convert a simple text containing a few structurally significant characters into an easily readable and clearly formatted document. For instance:

- A line beginning with a single pound or hash sign (#) becomes an important title. A sentence beginning with two pound or hash signs appears as a less important title.
- A text beginning and ending with a star sign (*) is highlighted, while one that begins and ends with two stars becomes even more visible.

What about formatting styles?

Natao uses style sheets. A few examples of these are made available as soon as the program starts. You may modify them and even create your own.

# Next Steps

You should now have a better idea of what Natao is and what it can allow you to accomplish.
If you decide to go further, click on the question mark icon located at the top, right corner of Natao's interface. A new window will pop up and let you delve deeper into the program.

I hope you will find Natao easy to use and useful to your work.

Thanks and good luck!
