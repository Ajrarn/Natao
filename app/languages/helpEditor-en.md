This bar, located at the top of the Editor panel, lets you access the core functions of Natao.

## Zoom-In & Zoom-Out

 - <span class="typcn typcn-zoom-out-outline"></span> Increases the size of all the characters used in Natao's user interface.
 - <span class="typcn typcn-zoom-in-outline"></span> Decreases the size of all the characters used in Natao's user interface.

You should note that Natao saves interface modifications automatically. In other words, you won't have to go over them again after re-launching the program.

## Dyslexia

<span class="typcn typcn-lightbulb"></span> Lets you activate *OpenDyslexic* characters for the whole of the program's interface. These characters are designed to help dyslexics read words on screen.

## The Three Panels

- <span class="typcn typcn-th-menu-outline"></span> This button lets you hide/display your documents' navigation panel, which is also called **Documents**.
- <span class="typcn typcn-edit"></span> This button lets you hide/display the Markdown editor panel.
- <span class="typcn typcn-eye-outline"></span> This button lets you hide/display the document Viewer panel.

## Print

<span class="typcn typcn-printer"></span> This button lets you print the document visible in the Viewer panel.

## Help

<span>?</span> This button lets you open Natao's Help window, which you are currently reading.

## Settings

<span class="typcn typcn-cog-outline"></span> This button lets you access Natao's Settings.

# The Documents Panel

## The Documents Panel Tool Bar
![Image of ExplorerBar](./src/images/documents.png)

This bar displays a click-able title to switch from the **Trash-Bin** view to the **Documents** view.
This bar displays three extra buttons which let you:

- <span class="typcn typcn-book"></span> Paste copied or cut content previously saved in Natao's clipboard.
- <span class="typcn typcn-download-outline"></span> Import content from a file.
- <span class="typcn typcn-plus-outline"></span> Add a folder at the root of **Documents**. During the creation of the folder, you have the option of selecting one of Natao's folder-structure templates. This will add sub-folders to the folder you're creating.

## The Documents Explorer Tool Bar

![Image of Explorer](./src/images/explorer.png)

Here appear your folders and documents, organized as you see fit.

- One click on a folder icon will either reveal or hide its content.
- One click on the folder's name will open a pop-up tool menu that will let you edit the folder.
- One click on a document will open it in the Editor panel, as an editable Markdown text, and in the Viewer panel, as a preview of its once printed.

## The Pop-up Folder Tool Menu

![Image of Explorer](./src/images/folderOptions.png)

- <span class="typcn typcn-edit"></span> Lets you modify the folder's name, its color, and its default style-sheet. You should note that modifying the folder's style-sheet neither changes the style of that folder's sub-folders, nor the documents it contains.
- <span class="typcn typcn-folder-add"></span> Lets you add a sub-folder to the folder you've selected. You may also choose to use one Natao's folder-structure templates. Natao will automatically create sub-folders that correspond to that template.
- <span class="typcn typcn-document-add"></span> Lets you add a document to the selected folder.
- <span class="typcn typcn-tabs-outline"></span> Lets you copy the selected folder and its content to Natao's clipboard.
- <span class="typcn typcn-scissors-outline"></span> Lets you cut the selected folder and its content to Natao's clipboard.
- <span class="typcn typcn-book"></span> Lets you paste the selected folder and its content to Natao's clipboard.
- <span class="typcn typcn-export-outline"></span> Lets you export the selected folder and its content as a single file.
- <span class="typcn typcn-download-outline"></span> Lets you import a file's content to the selected folder.
- <span class="typcn typcn-flow-children"></span> Lets you save the selected folders' sub-folder structure as a new template. Be aware that the content of these folders and sub-folders is not saved. The new template will be usable each time you create new folders and sub-folders.
- <span class="typcn typcn-trash"></span> Lets you delete the selected folder and its content.

## The Trash-Bin

Selected, the trash-bin lets you see all the documents that you've marked for deletion.

You may :

- <span class="typcn typcn-trash"></span> Delete the documents for good.
- <span class="typcn typcn-media-rewind-outline"></span> Restore the documents marked for deletion to their original location (when possible).

# The Editor Panel

This panel lets you write your documents.

## Functions Overview

Three input-fields are available:

- *Title*: your document's title is independent of your document's core content. This allows you to see it within the Explorer panel. The document's title also appears in the Viewer panel.

- *Style*: the style you select modifies your documentâ€™s formatting in the Viewer pannel. You can modify these styles, as we'll see in a later part of our Help section.

- *Creation Date*: your document's creation date. By default, this is the date displayed by your computer. You can modify your document's creation date: you can, for instance, make it the date at which you're supposed to return your homework. Please note that the way the date appears in your document depends on the style-sheet you've selected.

Besides the three input-fields, additional buttons are present. These function similarly to the ones seen in the Explorer panel.

- <span class="typcn typcn-tabs-outline"></span> Lets you copy the active document, including its input-fields, to Natao's clipboard.
- <span class="typcn typcn-scissors-outline"></span> Lets you cuts the active document to Natao's clipboard.
- <span class="typcn typcn-export-outline"></span> Lets you export the active document to a file.
- <span class="typcn typcn-trash"></span> Lets you delete the active document. When you do, the Editor and Viewer windows will disappear, until you create a new document.

## Inserting an Image

- <span class="typcn typcn-image-outline"></span> Lets you insert an image in your document. The Markdown Help offers more details on this function in the *Images* chapter.

## The Editor Settings

The <span class="typcn typcn-cog"></span> button allows you to change the way the content seen in the Editor panel is displayed. The two available options are specifically designed to help people with visuospatial perception difficulties.

Specifically, this button lets you:

- Add gray and white stripes to your document. Some of the document's lines will turn gray, while others will remain white. This juxtaposition of gray and white lines will help you better navigate your document.
- Add space between lines by increasing their size, which adds space between the lines of text within your document.

## Text Search Function

The <span class="typcn typcn-zoom-outline"></span> button lets you open a search box above the Editor to look for text within the document currently being edited.

The text you insert in the search box will be highlighted within your document. The number of occurrences of the searched text will also be indicated. 

The <span class="typcn typcn-arrow-left-outline"></span> and <span class="typcn typcn-arrow-right-outline"></span> arrows are designed to help you position the editing cursor on the various occurrences of the searched text. Said text will become highlighted with a darker color.

You may also replace the text you've searched for with whatever words you insert in the *Replace with* option.

- <span class="typcn typcn-arrow-repeat"></span> lets you replace the text currently highlighted in your document.
- <span class="typcn typcn-arrow-repeat-outline"></span> lets you replace all the occurrences of the text you've searched for.

## The Markdown Editor

The Editor is composed of a window where you may write your Markdown text (to learn more about this syntax, I invite you  to consult the Markdown help section).

Alongside that window, a vertical bar either displays numbers or symbols depending on the context. Small triangles will appear here, ones that, once clicked, will open or fold you document to let you inspect its structure.

You will notice that the editor adds colors, differend font sizes, etc. to your Markdown text to hep you navigate it more easily.

# The Viewer Panel

This panel, the simplest of the three, may also be the most important. With it, you can see what your document will look like once it is printed. When you click on the <span class="typcn typcn-printer"></span> button, the entire Viewer panel will expand before asking you if you want to print your document or not.
